  <br>
  <em>My Budget Workhorse: HP Compaq 8300 SFF (i5-3470, 8GB RAM)</em>
</p>

 Hardware Spec
• CPU: Intel Core i5-3470 @ 3.20GHz

• RAM: 8GB DDR3 (The real challenge!)

• Storage: 256GB SSD

• Network: 1Gbps Fiber

 Tech Stack
• OS: Linux (Headless)

• Management: Portainer (Mobile App) & Termius (SSH)

• Containers: 15+ services optimized for low RAM usage.

## Resource Usage Overview

Average resource consumption measured via `docker stats` under standard operating conditions.

| Service              | CPU Usage (Avg) | RAM Usage (Avg) | Priority |
|:---------------------|:----------------|:----------------|:---------|
| AdGuard Home         | 0.1% - 0.5%     | 120 MB          | High     |
| Portainer Agent      | 0.1%            | 30 MB           | Medium   |
| Gatus                | 0.2%            | 45 MB           | Medium   |
| Tailscale            | 0.1%            | 25 MB           | High     |
| Passive Income Apps  | 1.0% - 3.0%     | 250 MB          | Low      |
| **Total Ecosystem** | **~5.0%** | **~1.2 GB** | --       |

*Note: System load remains stable during concurrent DNS queries. Background tasks are optimized to prevent resource spikes.*

## Project Economics

| Category | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Hardware Cost** | **0 PLN** (Salvaged office hardware) |
| **Power Consumption** | ~15W - 25W (Idle/Light Load) |
| **Estimated Monthly Cost** | ~12 - 18 PLN (Electricity) |
| **Profitability** | Passive income apps aim to offset 100% of power costs |

> [!NOTE]
> The hardware was acquired for free during a corporate office upgrade. This makes the project a 100% recycled "zero-cost" build where every earned penny covers the operational expenses.
