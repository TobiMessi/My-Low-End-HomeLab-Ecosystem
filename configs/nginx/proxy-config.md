**Nginx Proxy Manager Configuration**

---

I use Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) to create "home-made domains" for my services. This allows me to access them via friendly names instead of IP addresses and ports.

Key Features:
SSL Management: Automatic Let's Encrypt certificates for secure https access.

Efficiency: Very low RAM footprint, perfect for my 8GB DDR3 limit.

Access Lists: I restrict sensitive services (like Portainer) to my local network only.
