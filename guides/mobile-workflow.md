100% Mobile-First Administration

This is what people ask about most on Reddit. I don't use a local monitor or keyboard. Here is my mobile toolkit:

1. Termius (SSH)
My primary terminal for iPhone/Android. It allows me to connect to my server from anywhere in the world. I use "Snippets" to run frequent commands without typing them manually.

2. Portainer (Web GUI)
Instead of complex Docker commands, I use Portainer's web interface. It works perfectly in mobile browsers, allowing me to restart containers and check logs on the go.

3. Tailscale (Secure Remote Access)
I use Tailscale as a Zero-Config VPN. It allows me to access my home network securely from school or public Wi-Fi without opening any dangerous ports on my router.
